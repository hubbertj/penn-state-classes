# Courses

This directory contains coursework organized by course.

## Structure

Each course should have its own directory with the following structure:

```
course-name/
├── README.md              # Course overview and assignment list
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
├── assignment-1/          # Individual assignments
├── assignment-2/
└── notes/                 # Course notes and materials
```

## Adding a New Course

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive course name (e.g., `machine-learning`, `deep-learning`, `nlp`)
2. Add a README.md with course information
3. Create a requirements.txt if the course has specific dependencies
4. Organize assignments and projects in subdirectories
