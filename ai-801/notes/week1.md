# Chapter 1: Introduction
This chapter defines the field of Artificial Intelligence and explores its historical and theoretical foundations.

* **Definition of AI:** AI is defined as the study of **agents** that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions. 
* **The Standard Model:** AI is primarily concerned with **rational action**. An ideal intelligent agent takes the best possible action in a given situation to achieve its objectives.
* **The Turing Test:** Proposed by Alan Turing, this is an "imitation game" where a machine must fool a human examiner into believing it is also human through its behavior.

### Foundations of AI
* **Philosophy:** Explored the idea of the mind as a machine and the use of internal language for thought.
* **Mathematics:** Provided tools for logic (formalized reasoning), computation (algorithms), and handling uncertainty through probability.
* **Economics:** Formalized decision-making to maximize "expected utility".
* **Neuroscience/Psychology:** Provided insights into how brains work and how biological entities process information.
* **Linguistics:** Driven by Natural Language Processing (NLP), connecting language use to information processing.

# Chapter 2: Intelligent Agents
This chapter focuses on the design and task environments of intelligent agents.

* **Agents and Environments:** An agent perceives its environment through **sensors** and acts upon it through **actuators**.
    * **Example:** A robotic agent uses cameras (sensors) and motors (actuators).
* **The PAGE (PEAS) Construct:** This is the standard framework for describing a "task environment":
    * **P**erformance measure: The criteria for success (e.g., safety, speed, or cost-effectiveness).
    * **A**ctuators: The tools used to act (e.g., wheels, robotic arms, or software commands).
    * **G**ensors: The tools used to perceive (e.g., cameras, microphones, or file inputs).
    * **E**nvironment: The space where the agent operates.


### Categorizing Environments
* **Observable vs. Partially Observable:** Whether an agent's sensors give it access to the complete state of the environment at each point in time.
