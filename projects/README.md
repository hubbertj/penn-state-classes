# Projects

This directory contains major projects, capstone work, and research projects.

## Structure

Each project should have its own directory with comprehensive documentation:

```
project-name/
├── README.md              # Project overview, objectives, and results
├── requirements.txt       # Dependencies
├── src/                   # Source code
├── data/                  # Data files (if not too large)
├── notebooks/             # Jupyter notebooks
├── docs/                  # Additional documentation
└── results/               # Outputs, figures, and analysis results
```

## Project Guidelines

- Include clear documentation of objectives, methodology, and results
- Add setup instructions and usage examples
