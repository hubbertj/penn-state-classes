# DAAN 862: Analytics Programming and Software Engineering

This repository contains the coursework, analytical pipelines, and the final project for **DAAN 862** at Penn State University. The course focuses on the development of robust analytics systems using Python, moving beyond basic scripting toward established software design principles.

## 🎯 Course Objectives
* Build production-grade analytics systems using **Python**.
* Implement advanced data manipulation and wrangling with **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
* Develop and evaluate machine learning models using **Scikit-Learn**.
* Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques via **NLTK**.
* Practice software project management best practices (modular design, documentation, and quality assurance).



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Environment:** Anaconda (Spyder IDE)
* **Core Libraries:**
    * **Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
    * **Modeling:** Scikit-Learn
    * **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
    * **NLP:** NLTK, Regular Expressions (`re`)

## 📂 Project Structure

## 🚀 Key Learning Milestones

### **Data Wrangling**
Applying Pandas 2.0+ features like `melt`, `pivot`, and `crosstab` to handle complex, high-dimensional datasets.

### **Model Engineering**
Transitioning from simple model fitting to building full pipelines, including feature engineering, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.

### **Software Design**
Emphasis on modularity (writing reusable `.py` modules) and thorough documentation.
